        <h2>1. Valorant</h2>
        <p>As a fellow valo player, although, ALTHOUGH, it might be a little toxic sometimes, it is a fun game to play. You can like relieve your stress or maybe increase your adrenaline sometimes when you have to clutch the game when everyone is dead and just watches you....</p>

        <h2>2. Wuthering Waves</h2>
        <p>It has a very good storyline, and the graphics they have is amazing. Highly reccomend for guys since there's more female characters but it is a good game. It is a mix of genshin and honkai star rail. The fighting scenes are good and their playstyles and their fighting mechanics are superb.</p>

        <h2>3. Roblox</h2>
        <p>An extremely popular game. There's a variety of games in this game. You can play horror, tycoon, simulators and what not here, so you won't ever get bored!! Highly recommend to play with friends cuz the more the merrier. Or maybe it's just cuz I find it boring without playing with friends.</p>
