            <h2>ðŸ’– Romance Anime</h2>
            <ul class="anime-list">
                <li><strong>Horimiya</strong> â€“ One of the classics. It's a funny yet romantic anime with a strong fl and a more shy ml.</li>
                <li><strong>Honey Lemon Soda</strong> â€“ It's a new one, but a good one. It's extremely pure where the fl is traumatised and the ml saves her from her trauma.</li>
                <li><strong>Romantic Killer</strong> â€“ Beware! You might want more of it. It's an extremely funny anime, romcom if I would say. Good but underated.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="genre">
            <h2>ðŸ”¥ Action Anime</h2>
            <ul class="anime-list">
                <li><strong>Attack on Titan</strong> â€“ A classic and popular anime. Not my type, but it has a good storyline, kinda depressing but the depth of the characters emotion and the fighting scenes are superb.</li>
                <li><strong>Demon Slayer</strong> â€“ A very happy ml trying to save his sister. Tragic and traumatising too, he faced a lot of trauma, poor guy. Same goes to the other animes I recommended. Amazing graphics!</li>
                <li><strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong> â€“ MY fav by far. Their fighting scenes are top notch and each guy in the anime is fineeee. A LOT of trauma and depression, BEWARE. But their looks make up for it. Storyline is just chef's kiss.</li>
